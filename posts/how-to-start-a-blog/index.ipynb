    "## Blogging for Back-end Devs\n",
    "I'll be honest with you: I have no clue what front-end developers do. I think it involves JavaScript, and some form of HTML voodoo, and thumb wrestling with reactive layouts that just won't react right. Luckily, when I set out to create this blog, a friend put me on to Quarto! Quarto is an amazing tool that lets you create beautiful blogs (and presentations, and books!) without having to leave your cozy jupyter notebook environment. There are of course simpler ways to create a blog (shout-out WordPress), but I wanted to be able to include runable code in my posts and have more control over format.\n",
    "\n",
    "This post describes the steps I took to create and publish this blog. For the sake of brevity, I'll gloss over the exact blow-by-blow and focus on broader steps. I assume that you are fairly comfortable knocking around a jupyter notebook, installing packages and all that (if not, I'm sure google can get you started). I used VS Code for this project, but I believe Quarto integrates well with a wide range of environments."

    "## Creating the Blog\n",
    "Quarto has great documentation, I won't waste pixels repeating it here. I followed their [VS Code Quick Start](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) guide far enough to see the sample page rendering, then jumped right into their [Creating a Blog](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) guide. Their system is very slick; once you have the project folder created, you can just create a new folder under posts, toss a index.ipynb or index.qmd in there (I stuck with notebooks), and you have a new post. Set the first cell of the notebook to raw text, rather than code or markdown, and paste in their special header (example below is the header for this post!)"

You should see your new notebook as a post alongside their example posts, with everything already formatted nicely and linked up. At this point, you have a blog!
